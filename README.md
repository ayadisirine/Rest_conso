"# Rocket-Elevators-Rest-API" 



In this project we Created Rest Apis for Rocket Elevators. and the link for our differents Apis are below and you can test it in Postman
here is example of how u can access our api

1. For Elevator to retrive, for example elevator with id==3, you use GET

https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/elevators/3
and for Changing ITS status you will use PUT and in Body => raw change on of elevator status ("Active" or "Inactive" or "Intervention") in Json format like this:
{
    "status" : "Inactive"
}

If the results input is Success, use GET to see the resluts of the changed status.

To get the elevators in Interventio use :
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/elevators/status/intervention, 
and to GET inactive you can use 
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/elevators/status/inactive

2.This will be the same for Batteries and Columns. If you want to see all the batteries for example, use GET
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Batteries
, and for columns
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Columns

to retrieve the information use the same link /(the id in numbers of the battery you want) for example here we want one so we use  https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Batteries/1
to change the information you do the same as abose USE PUT and choose in (Online, Offline or Intervention")

{
 
 "Status": "Online"
}

3. For The building if you want to get all the Buildings use GET
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Buildings
to get building  that contain at least one battery, column or elevator requiring intervention
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Buildings/Intervention

4. For the Lead, to Get all the Leads
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Leads
and to retrieve a list of Leads created in the last 30 days who have not yet become customers
https://sirinerocketelevatorsrestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/Leads/30daysnotcustomers

So in more Details with Codes:

We Scaffolded our The entities which are the Models folder That we had in Mysql Server.and every  model is a set of classes that represent the data that the app manages. for example in Batteries Class we have:

        public long Id { get; set; }
        public long? BuildingId { get; set; }
        public string Status { get; set; }
        public DateTime? DateCommissioning { get; set; }
        public DateTime? DateLastInspection { get; set; }
        public string CertificateOfOperations { get; set; }
        public string Information { get; set; }
        public string Notes { get; set; }
        public string BatteryType { get; set; }

We have a database context(rocketelevators_developmentContext) is the main class that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for a data model.and for our Batteries Class, its relation is:
modelBuilder.Entity<Batteries>(entity =>
            {
                entity.ToTable("batteries");

                entity.HasIndex(e => e.BuildingId)
                    .HasName("index_batteries_on_building_id");

                entity.Property(e => e.Id)
                    .HasColumnName("id")
                    .HasColumnType("bigint(20)");

                entity.Property(e => e.BatteryType)
                    .HasColumnName("battery_type")
                    .HasMaxLength(255);

                entity.Property(e => e.BuildingId)
                    .HasColumnName("building_id")
                    .HasColumnType("bigint(20)");
We use difference Controllers to expose Async API Endpoints for CRUD operations. For example in Batteries controller, 
[HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<Batteries>> GetBattery(long id)
        {
            var battery = await _context.Batteries.FindAsync(id);

            if (battery == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            return battery;
        }
And we can see the results our our request in Postman.
